<h2 id="content">A breakdown of who I am and what I do</h2>
<p>I am a Lead DevOps Engineer and a full stack developer (and I love to discuss the meaning of "DevOps"). I also ran a collegiate cyber security club for several years and am CompTIA Security+ certified, so I can speak to cyber security as well. Please, do not hesitate to reach out via the contact form if you have any questions, or connect with me on LinkedIn as well.</p>

		<h3>Work Experience</h3>
		<p>I was jump started in my career when I did much more at Blackbaud than a typical intern would be expected to. In fact, I was the longest standing member of my team before I left (which lead to me handling most work for legacy systems). I then went to STOPSO and was made Tech Lead working on an Angular(7/8) and Java Spring application, leading a team of 6 developers. Currently I work at CommIT as a Lead DevOps Engineer supporting several Veterans Affairs contracts. In this role I use Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes for the majority of my work.</p>

		<h3>Current Goals</h3>
		<p>While I believe in keeping options open, I am currently happy at CommIT. I have been able to grow both personally and professionally, and being able to help US veterans is quite the benefit. I plan to further my learning and acheive several certifications during my time at CommIT. All of that being said, I am always open to learning about opportunities that might benefit myself or others that I know.</p>
