My current project is a starter kit for creating MultiTenant Software as a Service (SAAS) applications. It is written in Asp.Net Core 3.0 utilizing the Razor frontend and a RESTful API for authentication, service authorization, and other common requirements in a MultiTenant environment. I have a video below detailing the vision and status of the project.
